# CSE13RS

This repository contains an implementation of UCSC's CSE13S assignments... but in Rust instead!

I thought the assignments were a nice way to gain familiarity with a programming language, and I
have been meaning to pick up Rust, so this is my way of doing so. Each subfolder contains its own
README.md describing itself, and is an independent Cargo project.
